# Hey there! 👋 I'm Niloofar

**Cognitive Science-driven Product Designer | AI + Healthcare Enthusiast | Accessibility Advocate**

I design intuitive, accessible interfaces for complex problems. My sweet spot is where **Cognitive Science meets Product Design**—building AI-integrated healthcare tools that don't just work, they feel natural.

## 🎯 What I'm About

I'm passionate about designing human-centered experiences that **reduce cognitive load** and **increase accessibility**. With a background in both design and engineering, I bridge the gap between what's technically possible and what's genuinely useful for users. My work focuses on:

- 🏥 **Healthcare & Wellness Tech** — Designing for users who need clarity, not complexity
- 🤖 **Human-Centered AI** — Making AI systems understandable and trustworthy
- ♿ **Accessibility-First Design** — Because inclusion isn't optional, it's fundamental
- 🧠 **Cognitive Science Applications** — Using research insights to design smarter interfaces

## 🧠 My Design Philosophy

**1. Cognitive Load is Currency**
Users have limited attention. Every interface element should earn its place. I obsess over information architecture, mental models, and reducing unnecessary complexity.

**2. Accessibility Isn't a Feature, It's a Requirement**
Designing for accessibility makes products better for *everyone*. WCAG compliance isn't my ceiling—it's my floor.

**3. Research-Informed > Opinion-Driven**
Whether it's cognitive science research or user testing, I let data guide decisions. Assumptions are the enemy of good design.

**4. Bridge the Designer-Developer Gap**
I code my prototypes and understand technical constraints. This means I design *with* engineers, not at them.
