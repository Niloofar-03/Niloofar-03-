# 👋 Hi, I'm Niloofar

**Cognitive Science-driven UI/UX Designer | AI-Integrated Healthcare & Accessibility Specialist**

I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive frontend interfaces through a unique blend of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Cognitive Science**, and **Engineering**. With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in designing **WCAG-compliant, accessible, and high-performance products** that solve real-world accessibility gaps.

## 🎯 About Me

I don't just design static mockups—I build **functional prototypes** that respect technical constraints and reduce developer handoff friction. My work centers on creating inclusive, human-centered experiences for underserved populations, particularly in healthcare and accessibility technology.

**Currently pursuing:** B.A. (Honours) in Cognitive Science with AI and HCI Specialization at York University (2026)
